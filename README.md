colored-hashtag
===============

This chrome extension colors hashtagged Trello cards to easily distinguish them.

A hashtag is useful to categorize cards e.g, in scrum you may add `#<story id>` to specify to which story belongs. 

This plugin extracts hashtag in a card title and change cards' background color according as it. This feature enhances visibility and you might be able to distinguish cards at a glance.

### Release notes

#### v1.0.2

#### v1.0.1

### Limitations

* There are only 10 preset colors, then if you have 10+ hashtags they would share the same color.
* Hashtags in a new card would not be colored - please reload the page or edit a card's title to refresh.
* If multiple hashtags are in a title, the former one's color would be applied.
