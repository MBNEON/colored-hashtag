colored-hashtag
===============

This chrome extension colors hashtagged Trello cards to easily distinguish them.
A hashtag is useful to categorize cards e.g, in scrum you may add #<story id> to specify to which story belongs to. 

This plugin extracts hashtag in a card title and change cards' background color according as it. This feature enhances visibility and you might be able to distinguish cards at a glance.

<Limitation>

* Only 10 colors are preset, then multiple hashtags would share the same color if you have 10+ hashtags.
* Hashtags in a new card would not be colored - please reload the page or edit a card's title to refresh.
* If multiple hashtags are in a title, the latter one's color would be applied.
